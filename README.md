##Model-based design is a powerful design technique for embedded systems. It comprises of executable specification, design with simulation, implementation and continuous test and verification. In this project, these steps are combined into an iterative design methodology for model-based design of a microprocessor, from concept to realization. This project concentrates on the combined design and implementation as model elaboration.

The approach used in this project is to implement single core processor model and multicore processor model using LabVIEW. LabVIEW features allow us to develop models embedded systems in more efficient way. The project is divided in two parts, the first part of this project is to develop a single core processor model with a small instruction set as an example, in order to realize the basic functionality of the processor. The second part is basically the extension of the prior design, to develop multicore processor setup and test it with five instructions set for each core.
